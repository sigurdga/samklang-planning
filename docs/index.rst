=============================
Introduction
=============================

This is not yet built. We are just planning the planning tool.

We would like to take a scrum approach, but we will simplify it a bit to fit smaller organizations. Maybe we'll extend it later.

Everything is happening around **projects**, and Projects are core components of Samklang.

Scrum is mainly built around running **sprints**. Planned features and bug reports will be created as **user stories** or **issues** (being the same thing here). If they are not assigned to a sprint, they will take part of the backlog.

Customers and project owners are usually discussing the project level, the project owner will plan sprints with the scrum-master, wishing for issues to be worked on. The project groups will estimate the issues/user stories, do the scrum planning as they usually do. The **task** or **subtask** level is mainly for the developers to plan their work into todo lists. We will keep the tasks as simple as possible.

Future Work
==============================

Everything needs to be done.
